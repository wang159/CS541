  Test 1 does a simple test of normal buffer manager operations:
  - Allocate a bunch of new pages
  - Write something on each one
*** Could not pin new page 100
bufmgr.BufferPoolExceededException: No unpinned buffer frame.
	at bufmgr.BufMgr.pinPage(BufMgr.java:154)
	at tests.BMDriver.test1(BMTest.java:178)

	at tests.BMDriver.runTests(BMTest.java:88)
	at tests.BMTest.main(BMTest.java:640)

  Test 2 exercises some illegal buffer manager operations:
  - Try to pin more pages than there are frames
*** Pinning too many pages
  --> Failed as expected 

  - Try to free a doubly-pinned page
*** Freeing a pinned page
  --> Failed as expected 

  - Try to unpin a page not in the buffer pool
*** Unpinning a page not in the buffer pool
  --> Failed as expected 

  Test 2 completed successfully.

  Test 3 exercises some of the internals of the buffer manager
  - Allocate and dirty some new pages, one at a time, and leave some pinned
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
